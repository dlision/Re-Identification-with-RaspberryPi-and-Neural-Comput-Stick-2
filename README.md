# Re-Identification with RaspberryPi and Neural Compute Stick 2\* 

In this project, we will use two models person detection for retial and re-identification for retail. These models are availble in the Intel OpenVINO model zoo.
The person detection model for the Retail scenario is based on MobileNetV2-like backbone that includes depth-wise convolutions to reduce the amount of computation for the 3x3 convolution block. The single SSD head from 1/16 scale feature map has 12 clustered prior boxes.
This is us person reidentification model uses a whole body image as an input and outputs an embedding vector to match a pair of images by the Cosine distance. The model is based on RMNet backbone that was developed for fast inference. A single reidentification head from the 1/16 scale feature map outputs the embedding vector of 256 floats.

The models are listed in the file [model.lst](https://github.com/dlision/Re-Identification-with-RaspberryPi-and-Neural-Comput-Stick-2/blob/master/models.lst)

## How it works
The project workflow is the following:

1. The application reads tuples of frames from cameras/videos one by one. For each frame in tuple it runs object detector model listed in the models_list and save the detections into a file. The file formate is given below 

```json
[
    [  # Source#0
        {
            "frame_id": 0,
            "boxes": [[x0, y0, x1, y1], [x0, y0, x1, y1], ...],  # N bounding boxes
            "scores": [score0, score1, ...],  # N scores
        },
        {
            "frame_id": 1,
            "boxes": [[x0, y0, x1, y1], [x0, y0, x1, y1], ...],
            "scores": [score0, score1, ...],
        },
        ...
    ],
    [  # Source#1
        {
            "frame_id": 0,
            "boxes": [[x0, y0, x1, y1], [x0, y0, x1, y1], ...],  # N bounding boxes
            "scores": [score0, score1, ...],  # N scores
        },
        {
            "frame_id": 1,
            "boxes": [[x0, y0, x1, y1], [x0, y0, x1, y1], ...],
            "scores": [score0, score1, ...],
        },
        ...
    ],
    ...
]
```
The detection_only model will also save the recordings of the camera videos for later use in the ReID model.
2. Then in the second part ReID model reads the saved detections and videos from the detections model and run the ReID model to get the cosine descriptor for re-identification of person.
2. All embeddings are passed to tracker which assigns an ID to each object.
3. The project visualizes the resulting bounding boxes and unique object IDs assigned during tracking and save the tracks history into a JSON file.

## Running
